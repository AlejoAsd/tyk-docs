## What is the Tyk Pump?

The Tyk Pump is an analytics purger that enables you to move the analytics generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end.

Its primary use is to ensure that analytics data reaches the Dashboard, however it also has plugins for the following:

* MongoDB (to replace built-in purging)
* CSV
* ElasticSearch (2.0+)
* Graylog
* InfluxDB
* Moesif
* Splunk
* StatsD
* Hybrid (Tyk RPC)
* Prometheus
* Logz.io

See [Tyk Pump Configuration](/docs/configure/tyk-pump-configuration/) for more details.

Tyk Pump can be horizontally scaled without causing duplicate data.

Tyk Pump is an open-source project from the team here at Tyk and you can find its GitHub repository [here][1].
